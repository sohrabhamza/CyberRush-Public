# CyberRush-Public

This game was a submission for the Datorium Summer Game Jam.

Hi and welcome to the Cyber Rush Repo
I made this repo public so as to recive feedback on my code and/or for others to learn off of.

Most code has documenation in the form of comments but some UI scripts to do not.

If you want to fork this project, you must make your own leaderboard as providing the keys for mine would be disastorous. (Check highscores script)

The code that I am most proud of for this project is housed mainly in the levelmanager script so I advise you to check that out if you're interested.

ROADMAP
I'm done with this project. You can do whatever you want with it.
