# CyberRush-Public

This game was a submission for the Datorium Summer Game Jam.

Hi and welcome to the Cyber Rush Repo
I made this repo public so as to recive feedback on my code and/or for others to learn off of.

Most code has documenation in the form of comments but some UI scripts to do not.

If you want to fork this project, you must make your own leaderboard as providing the keys for mine would be disastorous. (Check highscores script)
I am planning on switching to firebase anyway so that part will be obselete.

The code that I am most proud of for this project is housed mainly in the levelmanager script so I advise you to check that out if you're interested.

ROADMAP

1. Fix any bugs (fixed that one Haden and Keron pointed out)
2. Switch to FireBase for login and leaderboard
3. Add player pickups like weapons and health
4. Port to android if I have time but may end up invalidating point 2 so may have to switch to the playgames login system. But yolo so might not do that and just add joysticks for movement lmao.

Also I broke the main scene when changing repos cuz im dumb and renamed it to something that already existed causing it to be overwritten. Then had to import it from the older version in my other repo and upgraded the stuff I remember. Some stuff may not have made it in so you may run into reference errors.
